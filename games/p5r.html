                            <b>01-16-2024</b> Oh boy Iâ€™m really feeling the post-game sads right now. Last night I finished third semester, watched both endings, and Iâ€™m just feeling so empty. It was a really beautiful and thought provoking story, and what I want is to apply what I felt and learned to my life, so that I can live a full, free, connected life. This game has made me think and feel so much over the past months, and I'm so grateful for that!

                                Thereâ€™s something about the nature of a social sim that really brings into focus how straightforward it can be to show up for those I care about. It can be as simple as investing time, listening and validating their experiences, and making memories together. It can be easy for me to overcomplicate things, to feel like I need to be doing more for the people in my life - but in reality just making time and space for people can be enough.Â 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I couldnâ€™t talk about this game without talking about Akechi (best boy). He was instantly one of my favorite characters. It was just nice to hear someone with a different opinion at first, up until that point it felt like we were in a bit of a Phantom Thieves echo chamber.  I believe that itâ€™s important to have people around you who support you, but there is also value in having people who challenge the way you think.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                i loved having him around throughout third semester - it was nice to see him being authentic to his darker/chaotic side. his lil evil laugh brought me so much joy ðŸ¤£.Â 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                when we meet with Maruki and we find out that Akechi actually did die in Shidoâ€™s palace, and that he was brought back by Maruki because we essentially wished it to be, I lost my marbles. Akechiâ€™s willingness to die in order to be the master of his own fate was equally heartbreaking - I wanted to accept Marukiâ€™s deal in that moment just to have a happy life with Akechi, but I wanted even more to respect his wishes.Â 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I think about what drew me to Akechiâ€™s character, I definitely related to his experience of feeling like he always had to present a pleasant mask to the world, otherwise risking rejection. I related to his desire to feel needed, something I still struggle with now. I think that believing what I do now - that everyone deserves to be loved in their wholeness, their dark along with their light - I felt compelled to offer that same love and forgiveness both as Joker and as myself.Â 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Seeing Akechiâ€™s struggles to find acceptance, and hopefully giving him at least a small sense of that in the time we spent with him was one of the biggest emotional payoffs of the game for me.Â
