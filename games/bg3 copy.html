                            my first character was a bard x wizard seladrine drow. she was an entertainer, and before the events of the game she travelled with a performing group across faerun.

                            i was pretty bad at remembering to take screenshots, tho, so this is the only photo i have of her

                            Antigone was my resist durge playthrough. this one was a duo run with just them and Astarion (for the most part). They were a gloomstalker assassin and rogue/thief duo. it was a pretty fun challenge on tactition and felt like good practice for my future honor mode run

                        <p>
                            Kunzi - a way of the open hand monk - was my first complete honor mode run. it was very fun smacking and stunning all the enemies, i would highly recommend the class to anyone ~
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            this was the first time i had two romances happening at once, and I almost quit this run after I had to break up with Karlach for Lae’zel. I forgot I couldn’t do the thing where I’m curious about a path and then go back for the option I truly want. In the end Lae’zel's romance was quite sweet and after she went back to the astral realm fight Vlaakith, I went to Avernus with Karlach, so it all worked out!

                        <p>
                            this was my first couch coop playthrough with my housemate! they played as Singkyi, half wood elf a Circle of Land Druid. Vex was a wood elf shadow monk/rogue. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            after 2 solo playthroughs it was nice to have someone else making all the big decisions and being sort of like a tour guide.

                        <p>
                            the current playthrough! I convinced D to try out honor mode and aside from some close calls in act i, it's been going pretty well!! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            in this run I'm playing as Nasrin, a college of lore bard. She loves performing to distract crowds while Iskra, a beastmaster ranger/rogue, stealths around and pickpockets all the merchants. once she runs back to camp with our goods, i'm there to convince shopkeeps that i saw absolutely nothing! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nasrin's  personal goal is to collect one copy of every book to build a library. It's been fun having that extra motivation, after so many playthroughs, i've had a reason to explore the game a bit more deeply.

                                    <b>take your time</b> - remember that there's never any rush to make a decision once you're in a fight - sometimes it even helps to save mid-fight and come back to it later. if things are going poorly and you rush your decisions, chances are it will only get worse! 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>have an exit plan</b> - especially in early game! and try to keep at least one invisibility potions/scroll on you at all times, when in doubt, run away and try again later! 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>leave someone behind</b> - if you feel like you may be under-leveled for an encounter, it doesn't hurt to send one party member back to camp. if things go poorly, you'll have someone on standby to res your team. if it's going well, you can bring them back to finish the fight
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>slightly dishonor mode</b> - this won't work if you get a TKO, but if there's a story moment that goes terribly wrong you can always ctl+alt+delete out of there (i suppose this is slightly less honorable, but sometimes its gotta happen! at the end of the day its your game, and you should feel free to play in whichever way is most fun)
