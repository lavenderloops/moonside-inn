                <p>Easily one of my favorite games of the year, I'm currently on my 5th playthrough
                                                            on a co-op save with my housemate.</p>

                <p>my first character was a bard x wizard seladrine drow. she was an entertainer,
                                                            and before the events of the game she travelled with a performing group across faerun.</p>
                <p>i was pretty bad at remembering to take screenshots, tho, so this is the only photo
                                                            i have of her</p>

                <p>Antigone was my resist durge playthrough. this one was a duo run with just
                                                            them and Astarion (for the most part). They were a gloomstalker assassin
                                                            and rogue/thief duo. it was a pretty fun challenge on tactition and felt like
                                                            good practice for my future honor mode run

                <h2 id="kunzi">Kunzi</h2>
                <p>Kunzi - a way of the open hand monk - was my first complete honor mode run.
                                                            it was very fun smacking and stunning all the enemies, i would highly recommend
                                                            the class to anyone ~
                </p>
                <p>this was the first time i had two romances happening at once, and I almost quit this run after
                                                            I had to break up with Karlach for Lae’zel. I forgot I couldn’t do the thing where I’m curious
                                                            about a path and then go back for the option I truly want. In the end Lae’zel's romance was quite
                                                            sweet
                                                            and after she went back to the astral realm fight Vlaakith, I went to Avernus with Karlach, so it
                                                            all worked out!
