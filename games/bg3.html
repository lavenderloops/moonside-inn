                <p>Easily one of my favorite games of the year, I'm currently on my 5th playthrough
                    on a co-op save with my housemate.</p>

                <h2 id="Melasi">Melasi</h2>
                <p>my first character was a bard x wizard seladrine drow. she was an entertainer,
                    and before the events of the game she travelled with a performing group across faerun.</p>
                <p>i was pretty bad at remembering to take screenshots, tho, so this is the only photo
                    i have of her</p>

                <h2 id="Antigone">Antigone</h2>
                <p>Antigone was my resist durge playthrough. this one was a duo run with just
                    them and Astarion (for the most part). They were a gloomstalker assassin
                    and rogue/thief duo. it was a pretty fun challenge on tactition and felt like
                    good practice for my future honor mode run
                </p>

                <h2 id="kunzi">Kunzi</h2>
                <p>Kunzi - a way of the open hand monk - was my first complete honor mode run.
                    it was very fun smacking and stunning all the enemies, i would highly recommend
                    the class to anyone ~
                </p>
                <p>this was the first time i had two romances happening at once, and
                    partway through act II i forgot it was honor mode when i chose to
                    battle lae'zel to show her my love (i was curious! i had to see what would happen!)
                    but i was quite literally heartbroken when i had to tell Karlach the next day.
