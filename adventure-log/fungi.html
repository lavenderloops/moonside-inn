                            <p>first stop after i landed was jollibee in the mall - i haven't had it since we went together in seattle! it was just as good as i remembered!</p>
                            <p>in the evening we went to fugni night at calsci. the elevator from the top of the rainforest down to the aquarium was so cool, i wish i had a better photo of it! </p>
                            <p>this was my second time visiting sf, but the frist was for a conference, so i was mostly just anxious and overstimulated</p>
