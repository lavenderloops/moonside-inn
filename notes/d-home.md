# welcome to moonside inn!

this is a place where you take a rest, eat some snacks. we even have a game room where you can hang out, and a movie theater downstairs. if it gets too noisy you can head up to the attic library - there's a strict no noise policy up there so you can rest easy. i hope you can feel safe and cozy while your here! 

where would you like to go first?
