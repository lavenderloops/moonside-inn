                            at first it felt too good to be true with how 
                            simple it was to set up. turns out it was, 
                            since my laptop refused to boot it after being 
                            shut down. after trying out a few different 
                            distros i ended up going with

                            (which not only sounds cute, but actually worked!) 
                            if you're on the fence, i'd def recommend trying it out. 
                            here are some vids i watched to help me decide/switch:
