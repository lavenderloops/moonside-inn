                    Transplanar is an dark fantasy actual play TTRPG podcast and live show. The stories all take place in a noncolonial, antiorientalist multiverse. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The casts and crew are people of color and trans led, and the stories focus on themes of queer/trans love, as well as grief, religion, monstrosity, and fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 2 main campaigns, [[the second stranger]] and [[the chaos protocol]], as well as two limited series of an original, 2-player TTRPG designed by Connie, [[godkiller]].
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first learned about this show through one of Connie's tiktoks. At the time I'd never played or watched D&D, and what a fantastic introduction this was. I'd never felt like there was a place for me in TTRPG spaces, and this show proved how wrong I was. It has had a huge impact on me creatively, and more broadly has inspired me to show up for and love myself and my friends/community more fully.
