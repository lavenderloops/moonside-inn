                            <strong style="font-size: 18px;">Transplanar RPG</strong> is a <strong>dark fantasy</strong> actual play TTRPG podcast and live show. The stories all take place in a <strong>noncolonial, antiorientalist multiverse</strong>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The casts and crew are people of color and trans led, and the stories center on themes of <span class="highlight">queer/trans love, as well as grief, religion, monstrosity, and fate.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are 2 main campaigns, <a href="transplanar.html#stranger">the second stranger</a> and <a href="transplanar.html#chaos">the chaos protocol</a>, as well as two limited series of an original, 2-player TTRPG designed by <a href="transplanar.html#cast">Connie</a>, <a href="https://byconniechang.itch.io/godkiller-first-blood">godkiller</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I first learned about this show through one of Connie's [[tiktoks]]. At the time I'd never played or watched D&D, and this was such a fantastic way to be introduced. I'd never felt like there was a place for me in TTRPG spaces, and this show proved how wrong I was. It has had a huge impact on me creatively, and has showed me ways to love myself and my friends/community more fully.
