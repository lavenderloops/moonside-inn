                        <strong style="font-size: 18px;">Transplanar RPG</strong> is a <strong>dark fantasy</strong> actual play TTRPG podcast and live show. The stories all take place in a <strong>noncolonial, antiorientalist multiverse</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The casts and crew are people of color and trans led, and the stories focus on themes of <span class="highlight">queer/trans love, as well as grief, religion, monstrosity, and fate.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are 2 main campaigns, [[the second stranger]] and [[the chaos protocol]], as well as two limited series of an original, 2-player TTRPG designed by [[Connie]], [[godkiller]].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first learned about this show through one of Connie's [[tiktoks]]. At the time I'd never played or watched D&D, and what a fantastic introduction this was. I'd never felt like there was a place for me in TTRPG spaces, and this show proved how wrong I was. It has had a huge impact on me creatively, and more broadly has inspired me to show up for and love myself and my friends/community more fully.
