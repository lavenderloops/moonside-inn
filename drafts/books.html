                    You know what--Eggers gives a pretty decent attempt at remaking what is considered a “classic” by some, but mostly falls short (both narratively and visually) at making anything really strike fear into the heart of those--mainly me--watching..
                    <p>First, some captivating individual framings; Eggers does have some knack or talent for directing, but man does this whole film feel kind of lacking at least from an aesthetic viewpoint. I genuinely think Tim Burton would have benefited more from remaking this than Eggers, but whatever.</p>
                    <p>He does explore something intriguing as to “feminine desire” and how it might relate to sexuality, even if it doesn’t really come to fruition all that clearly. Themes are shaky, how the movie is shot as a whole is kind of shaky, overall just a pretty shaky movie that keeps you engaged for its over 2-hour runtime but doesn’t grasp at anything completely. Maybe unfinished? Perhaps rushed?</p>
                    <p>Rating: Nosfera-poo! Two thumbs down, yet one thumbs up for trying.</p>
