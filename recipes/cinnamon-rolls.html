            <ol>
                <li>
                    Mix the yeast and flour. In a seperate bowl, combine butter, sugar, salt, milk powder, and vanilla extract until well combined <i>but don't mix until light</i>
                </li>
                <li>Add the eggs gradually. Add water, and mix briefly. Add yeast and flour, mix to a smooth dough</li>
                <li>Knead until smooth and elastic (if kneading by hand, for about 5-10 minutes at a time with 10-15 minute rest periods)</li>
                <li>Once it looks like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/69kK3dh.png">this</a>, set it aside to rise for 45-60 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the dough is rising, make the cinnamon filling by combining the brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Make the honey pan glaze by warming the honey in a pan with the cinnamon stick, let it simmer lightly for 10-20 minutes before removing the cinnamon stick. Remove the honey from heat and stirring in the butter.</li>
                <li>Spread the honey glaze into the bottom of the pan you'll be using to bake the rolls.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick</li>
                <li>Spread the butter and springkle with cinnamon sugar mix</li>
                <li>Roll it up and cut into 2 inch rolls</li>
                <li>Place into the pan on top of the honey glaze and proof until doubled in size</li>
                <li>Bake at 375F, checking after 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>baker's notes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the dough was pretty sticky and needed about an extra 1/4 of flour during the kneading to come together smoothly</li>
                        <li>i used a 8x8 glass pyrex pan to bake these and they were kind of smooshed (i ended up with 10 rolls, you could probably make 9 chunky ones) but they were underbaked at first so maybe don't do what i did and use a bigger tray instead</li>
