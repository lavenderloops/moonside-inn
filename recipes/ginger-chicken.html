                            I got this recipe from a college friend when I asked them what to do with the chicken thighs I had defrosted the night before. This was my first time tempering an egg, and I've only gotten it right 1/3 of the times I've tried this recipe &#129315; I'm sure you could replace it with cornstarch or another thickening agent if you're not feeling confident about that step.
                        </p>

                            Note: She never really gave me measurements, so these are just estimates, but you can't really go wrong if you taste as you go.
