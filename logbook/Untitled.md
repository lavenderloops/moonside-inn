love it when a new hobby reveals itself to me. i used to be critical of the way that i hopped from interest to interest, always starting new projects. as I've gotten older it's become one of the things i love most about my creative process, though. everything i make is connected, and so while it might look like/feel like a million different things and ideas, its really all just one thing...me (˃ ᵕ ˂)
