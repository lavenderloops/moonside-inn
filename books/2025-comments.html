                    i'm soo glad i still had the audiobook saved for my 15+ hours of holiday travelling. this plus stardew valley are the only way i could have made it through!

                    I feel like S1 of the show and the first book were pretty close in how they interpreted everything, but this one was sooo different! while i did feel like it dragged on a little bit in the middle of the first book, i really appreciated some of the slower moments that the show rushed/completely skipped in this one. especially the introduction of Selene/Lanfear it was soo fun and ominous how she always appeared just to like nudge Rand in whatever direction she wanted.

                        is knowing you're the chosen one from birth (see sing from <a href="transplanarRPG/transplanar.html">transplanar</a>) better or worse than finding out as a teen/young adult? i feel like it'd be nice to have a normal childhood but idk the identity crisis for me as just a me was a lot, can't imagine being the chosen one on top of that lolol
